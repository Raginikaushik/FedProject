            <h2><u>Internship:</u></h2>
            We think being spoon-fed is the way to learn, but working independently has proved to be very important. 
            <br>Your internship will teach you to make my own decisions and do things on your own. 
            <br>Being able to work independently with little guidance is very important in the working world.
         <br>An internship can provide a student with paid professional work experience in a safe and structured 
         environment with help from experts. 
         <br>Internships help students master professional soft skills such as communication, 
         punctuality and time management.
<br>An internship will help you learn about your capabilities and ultimately encourage you to have a greater understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. 
<br>It can be a challenging experience at times. 
<br>Still, the benefits you gain from being pushed out of your comfort zone will help you tremendously in the future when you are presented with a difficult task or situation.
